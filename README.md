# Arithmetic Expression Examples

In this section, we will explore some basic **arithmetic expressions** in Python.  
Arithmetic expressions are used to perform calculations with numbers using operators such as:

- `+` : Addition  
- `-` : Subtraction  
- `*` : Multiplication  
- `/` : Division  
- `//` : Floor Division  
- `%` : Modulus (remainder)  
- `**` : Exponentiation (power)

### Examples:

1. `5 + 3` → Addition of two numbers  
2. `10 - 4` → Subtraction  
3. `6 * 7` → Multiplication  # Multiplication and Addition Examples

# Example 1: Multiply two numbers
a = 5
b = 3
product = a * b
print("Product of", a, "and", b, "is:", product)

# Example 2: Add two numbers
x = 10
y = 7
sum_result = x + y
print("Sum of", x, "and", y, "is:", sum_result)

# Example 3: Multiply and then add
result = (a * b) + (x + y)
print("Result of (a * b) + (x + y) is:", result)


4. `20 / 3` → Division  
5. `20 // 3` → Floor division  
6. `20 % 3` → Remainder  
7. `2 ** 3` → 2 raised to the power 3
# Multiplication and Addition Examples

# Example 1: Multiply two numbers
a = 5
b = 3
product = a * b
print("Product of", a, "and", b, "is:", product)

# Example 2: Add two numbers
x = 10
y = 7
sum_result = x + y
print("Sum of", x, "and", y, "is:", sum_result)

# Example 3: Multiply and then add
result = (a * b) + (x + y)
print("Result of (a * b) + (x + y) is:", result)
# Convert Minutes to Hours

# Example 1: Using a fixed number of minutes
minutes = 150
hours = minutes / 60
print(minutes, "minutes is equal to", hours, "hours")

# Example 2: Taking input from the user
minutes_input = int(input("Enter the number of minutes: "))
hours_input = minutes_input / 60
print(minutes_input, "minutes is equal to", hours_input, "hours")
